# Mint Files (Alpha)

A simple and basic open-source file explorer app with Material Design 3.

This is in alpha stage since I'm making this while learning Flutter, so the development will be slow.

## Features 

There isn't a lot feature right now. To look at possible upcoming features, look at Project tab.

- Create folder 

- Breadcrumbs navigation 

- Themes: Both light mode and dark mode available and automatically uses system color scheme on Android 12+ 

## Work in progress
